# Problem 3 :- Writing a function that takes a list and prints if the value 5 is in that list.
def check_five(lst):  # Define function
  if 5 in lst: # Iterate through list
    print('Number 5 is present in the list') # print to console
check_five([2,6,8,4,5]) #Call function & it will print automatically to console
